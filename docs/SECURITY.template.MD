# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take the security of NocoDB Simple Client seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### Preferred Reporting Method

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities via **GitHub Security Advisories** as it provides a secure and private channel for discussion.

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with detailed information

### Alternative Reporting Methods

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available or suitable, you can:

- **Email**: Send a detailed report to our security team
- **Issues**: For less sensitive matters, you may create a public issue (use your discretion)

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Reproduction**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Affected versions, configurations, or environments
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, provide a minimal example
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates during investigation
- **Resolution Timeline**: 
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 1-14 days
  - **Medium**: 1-30 days
  - **Low**: 1-90 days

## Supported Versions

{{SUPPORTED_VERSIONS_TABLE}}

We provide security updates for supported versions only. Please upgrade to a supported version if you're using an older release.

## Our Security Measures

### Repository Security

- **Branch Protection**: Main branches are protected with required reviews
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all maintainers
- **Signed Commits**: Encouraged for all contributions
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning via pip-audit and safety
- **PyPI Security**: Secure publishing with trusted publishing and API tokens

### Automated Security Scanning

We employ multiple layers of automated security scanning:

1. **Bandit**: Python security linter for common security issues
2. **Safety**: Checks dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
3. **pip-audit**: Audits Python packages for known vulnerabilities
4. **CodeQL**: Static analysis for code vulnerabilities
5. **Semgrep**: Additional static analysis for Python security patterns

### Package Security

Our Python package follows security best practices:

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced attack surface with minimal required dependencies
- **Version Pinning**: Specific dependency versions to prevent supply chain attacks
- **Secure API Communication**: HTTPS-only connections to NocoDB instances
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and API responses

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All changes require review by maintainers
2. **Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - Use specific versions rather than ranges when possible
   - Review new dependencies for security issues using `pip-audit` and `safety`
   - Keep dependencies updated and minimal
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize external inputs from NocoDB API
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information (API keys, database details) in error messages
6. **Python Security**: Follow secure Python coding practices and use `bandit` for security linting

### For Library Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest supported version from PyPI
2. **API Key Security**: 
   - Store NocoDB API keys securely (environment variables, key vaults)
   - Never hardcode API keys in your source code
   - Use read-only API keys when possible
3. **Network Security**: 
   - Always use HTTPS connections to NocoDB
   - Validate SSL certificates in production
4. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize data before sending to NocoDB
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information
6. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit your project dependencies

### For Python Package Maintainers

1. **PyPI Publishing**: Use trusted publishing or secure API tokens
2. **Version Management**: Follow semantic versioning for security updates
3. **Testing**: Include security-focused unit tests
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear security guidelines for users
5. **Vulnerability Response**: Respond promptly to security reports

## Security Monitoring

We continuously monitor our security posture through:

- **Automated Scanning**: Daily scans for vulnerabilities using Python security tools
- **PyPI Package Monitoring**: Monitoring for malicious packages with similar names
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Automated alerts for vulnerable dependencies
- **Access Logging**: Monitoring of repository access and changes
- **Community Reports**: Encouraging security research and responsible disclosure
- **Security Advisories**: Subscribing to Python and NocoDB security feeds

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and scope
2. **Containment**: Take immediate steps to limit exposure
3. **Investigation**: Thorough analysis of the incident
4. **Communication**: Transparent communication with affected parties
5. **Recovery**: Implement fixes and restore normal operations
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures
